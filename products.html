<h3>Working Products</h3>
<p>Resumes are static and boring creatures its more fun to show you the range of 
android mobile applications that can be created. What many people do not seem to 
realize that because Android is open that we developers can back port UI classes to 
get a 90 to 95 percent to the Android 4.0 look and feel from Android 2.1 to Android 
4.x.</p>
<p>I only interface with business owners and engineering hiring managers as I have found 
that any extra outside layer such as a recruiter messed up things beyond repair.
I flat fee estimates and do usually ask for the standard freelance close to 
50 percent upfront in cash of the project estimation. If that is not matching to 
your business than we are not afit and I suggest you find someone else.</p>
