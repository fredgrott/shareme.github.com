So while mobile hacking I build projects, products, and mobile services. I write about it here with some
insights into start-ups. We are in an exciting time where mobile devices and mobile services that connect
big data to our mobile devices are becoming the new Personal Computer.

Actuallly, mobile developers whether they are hadware hackers, mobile application hackers or 
mobile operating system hackers are building the Star Trek Communicator infrastructure or the 
SkyNET infrastructure depending uppon how you feel about all this new mobile technology.

But, my actual vision or what I envision is the ability to empower the human masses to not only 
multiply human knowledge and use of that human knowlede but multiply the opportunities for
everyone to pursue their life visions.  For many of us busy building mobile applications, mobile services, 
and or mobile hardware that is somewhat more fun than a lot of other activities.
