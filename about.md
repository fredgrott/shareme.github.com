## About Fred Grott and GrottWorkShop

Fred Grott is a hacker building products and services follwoing the mobile convergnce trend of mobile
devics becoming our stand-alone personal computer. He contributes to FOSS projects and has also 
contributed experies to tech coverage and technical training to such groups as DeviceTop(Espial-HAVi-iTV)
and IBM DeveloperWorks.

His main thesis is that there are convergence of trends that will turn the modern world upside down,
those being:
<ul>
        <li>Mobile electronics getting faster, smaller, and conserving more battery time</li>
        <li>As mobile CPU preformance improves and Browser VMs for Javscript improve more use of 
         html/css/js as the native mobile application platform</li>
         <li>As we move from native apps tp HTML5 mobile apps, the server infrastructure
         becomes more important</li>
         <li>More emphasis on mobile to the masses means that the emphasis on search changes
         from simple SEO to more robust multiple search paths and services including mobile
         apps as a search focus point</li>
         <li>The infux of smartphones accross high-end, middle-end, and low-cost ends will speed up 
         the disruptions of old industries and encourage gowth of new industries</li>
</ul>

He has at times contributed to such projects as WURFL, Antenna ANT tasks for MIDP development,
Eclipse IDE(MTJ), and the Android project. Fred Grott has built applications for Symbian, JavaME,
