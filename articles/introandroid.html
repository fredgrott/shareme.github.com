        <h3>Formation of Android INC</h3>
      <p>In 2003 several people go together to envision a new mobile operating 
          system that would be always aware of the users location and preferences. 
          This stealth tema was composed of Rubin(the co-founder of Danger), 
          Miner(Wildfire Communications), Sears(T-Mobile VP), and White(WebTV).</p>
       <p>Other competing teams were also coming up with the same smart-phone 
           concept but different implementations. Savaje OS ran JavaSE on bare metal 
           with a JavME-CDC plugin as deployed on some limited HP pda devices. </p>
       <p>Unfortunately, for Apple, Savje was the first to conceive of a mobile 
           device with a web browser and other features. An innovatio notice by

  <h2>Rapid Cellular Innovation</h2>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="span8">
        <h3>Mobile Technology</h3>
      <p>while the first mobile phone was invented inthe 1970s we really did not 
          get a huge spike in mobile technology innovation unti the late 1990s to early 2000s.
          There were several key areas of innovation.</p>
       <p>Several companies at the same time, including one in Canada, came up 
           with a Real-Time-Operating System concept of having a real-time OS power 
           the celluar-radio-chip and  have another OS power rest fo the features of 
           the phone and the applications.</p>

        <h3>Baseband Technology</h3>
      <p>When cell phones were invented in the 1970s they big heavy things and 
          that big and heavy trend carried well in the 1980s, Motorola's TAC-phones 
          where about 8lbs or more. Someone had to shrink down the electronics.</p>
          <p>During that progression towards shrinking of electronics into smaller 
              chips several came up with the cocnept of the cellular radio electronics 
              on one chip called a baseband chip</p>

        <h3>Celluar Radio  Technology</h3>
        <p>BellLabs first came up withe the cellar radio concept in the late 1940s. 
            Basically its a network of radio antennas that hands off receiving and sending 
            to a different antenna dependent on the location of the user's device.'</p>
      <p>During the 1980s and 1990s Cellular Radio Technology was very primitive 
          and not very fast. What began as slow cellular radio standard in Europe 
          named GSM became faster as antennna hardware electronics was shrunk 
          and softtware running the network became more feature compete and faster. </p>
    <p>CDMA, code division multiple access, actually first began as concepts in 
        the USSR and was first deployed as a service ofr mobile phones in cars. 
        As other countries also adpoted the technolgy it also ws also depoyd to 
        cars often civil service government units such as police. Qualcomm started 
        improving the technology and came up with some stadnrads that are 
        nicknamed cdmaOne, cdma2000.</p>

        <h3>GSM, and CDMA</h3>
        <p>GSM, an European stnadard, its is frequency modulated but ulike 
            FM-radio is modluated by <strong>gaussian shift hence the name 
                Gaussian Shift Modulation(GSM)</strong>.</p>
         <p>CDMA, code division multiple access, refers to takign a fast code and 
             xoring the slow data to that fast code to rpduce amodulated signal. 
             Each trasnmitters has a unique fast code and the resulting signals can 
             be multiplexed over one channel which is the <strong>multiple access 
                 part of CDMA</strong>.</p>

    <div class="span8">
        <h3>Goolge Acquires Android INC</h3>
      <p>In 2005, Google bought Android Inc with most of the team staying on 
          with Google. During 2005 to 2007 Google decided to come up with a new 
          way of implementing java.</p>
       <p>In JavaME java applications are constrained to the applicationlayer and 
           never enter the OS-layer. In pratical implemntation terms that meant that 
           the OEM was never able to upgrade the JavaVM on a javaME powered device 
           much to the disdain by users and security experts. Google came up with 
           the concept of using JNI to bridge between the C++/C parts of the OS and 
           the Java parts and thus could than implement arts of the OS in java.</p>
         <p>Google than modified the linux kernel they used to shrink the OS so 
             that they could than plan the OS as being bale to be updated  by OEMs. 
             This in part meant that we would see a switch form the mobile device 
             hardware being the selling point to the end user to the the software 
             feature set being the selling pointof that device.</p>

          as an open-source plaform. Goolge implemented java within the Android OS 
          as a clean room implementation  based on Apache Harmony and with a 
          register-based virtual machine called Dalvik.</p>
    <p>The very first Android device was released in August of 2008 and

  </div>
  <h2>Dalvik Virtual Machine</h2>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="span8">
        <h3>A new VM</h3>
      <p>Dalivk VM is named for a small town in Iceland by its creator. Dalivk is 
          implented as a register-based virtual machine.</p>
      <p>Thus, how is a register based VM faster than a stack based VM? Okay, 
          some specifics ot java is the fact that java byte-code is 8bit-based. 
         Now for the fun, in Dalvik registers are 16-bits wide which measn that 
         we can have one java code instruction and we have room 
         left over to store the 4-bit address of a local vaiable and thus 
         we get rid of having to do some separate pushes and pops from the 
         operand stack.  </p>
         <h3>The VM Sandbox</h3>
         <p>Usually, java VMs are sand-boxes but have all the applications execute 
             in that VM and if oen crashes all that applications have to be restarted.
             With Dalvik and Android OS we have what is known as a Dalvik VM 
             instance that runs one application in its own sand-box. That is why even 
             though you may have 256 Megabytes of device ram you only have the 
             ability to run so many 24meg applications at once.</p>
    <h3>The JIT</h3>
    <p>in 2010 Google introduced the Just-In-Time-compiler(JIT) for the 
        Android OS which is now foudn on all devics with andorid 2.3 and higher versions.
        Its basically a compiler optimizer for Dalvik that examines the dex code and 
        recompiles it for roptimization</p>
    <h3>Dex'ing</h3>
    <p>In most moible java environments we do not have a full compiler or 
        class-loader so we use a tol that modifies the class files to prepare them for 
        that slimmed down VM. In the Android case we use a DX tool and the file 
        it produces is called a dex file which is composed al of the modified classes 
        of the application. This is than stored in an applicaiton archive called an 
        apk which also contains the other resources of the android application.</p>

  <h2>The OS and Frameworks of Android'</h2>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="span8">
        <h3>An Android Application</h3>
    <p>To understand the OS and its frameworks lets go over what an android 
        application represents. An android application can interact with a 
        web browser, it can interact with a database, it can access and interact 
        with sensors of the moible phone, and it can process and interact with media.</p>
       <p>Thus, we have certain layers design to support those android application concepts.</p>
       <h3>Linux Layer</h3>
       <p>Google modified a stanadard linux kernel to form the foundation of the 
           andorid OS. The modifications were to exclude the X Windows system and 
           include a small subset of GNU standard libraries.</p>
           <p>The other part  of the linux layer is a set of drivers, some drive 
               hardware and some drive communications. </p>
          <h3>Anddroid Runtime</h3>
          <p>The Android Runtime is composed of now three components, the 
              dalvik VM, the JIT,, and the subset of the Apache Harmony Classes.</p>
           <h3>Framework Layer</h3>
           <p>The framework layer is composed of frameworks that are a mix of C++ 
               and java that  handle such things as SQLite, Webkit, the SurfaceManager,
               etc, and a Google modified Standard C library called Bionic libc. </p>
           <h3>Application Layer</h3>
           <p>The applicaiton sits on top of that stack to provide the api we write 
               applications to to interface with all the featrues and functions of the device
               while at the saem time managing security and permissions in such a 
               way that we have a use rmanaged sytem of permitting the applicaiton 
               to access  device system stuff.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="span4">
       <div class="well">
        <h3>Linux Kernel Layer</h3>
      <p>The linux kernel layer is a modified linux kernel designed to run on
