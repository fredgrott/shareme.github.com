## Purpose

This is based on Jekyll Template, JekyllBootstrap and several other sites to basically have all
my project pages in one location to easily market and manage. While I reuse the includes from 
Jade's JekyllBootstrap I am not uisng that system namespace setup.

## Usage

Okay I need to describe how to use the features. Page and Post metadata is:

layout(page only)

title

header

tagline(our hook line )



description(help seo as we have this added via g+ etc)

group(page only if wanted in the topnavbar, which would be the word navigation)

categories(post only, more than one is hieracy ..ie lessons, beginner is lessons/beginner so break up blog posts have blog category
and articles have article category  )

tags(post only)

In my setup articles are blog posts with at least two tags, articles and a subjectName.
