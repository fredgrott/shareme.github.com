<p>Hacking is considered exploring with the notion that information and learning 
should be free with the general rule of if you break it for others than you must 
fix it for others.Hacking is the enjoyment of exploring and learning.</p>


<p>There are several areas that I explore developing programs. Some of those 
areas are related to mobile such as Apache Cordova(phoneGap), development 
IDE apis such as Eclipse IDE, full frameworks such as Spring or Hibernate, 
and exploring brand new areas such as Grails/Groovy/Gradle, scripting 
MVC front ends such as Django, or NodeJS. </p>

<p>On top of this page you can find lists of projects by code repository and 
a dedicated listing of tech slides or you can just visit my code repos at 
either at <a href="https://bitbucket.org/fredgrott">Bitbucket.org</a> or at 
<a href="https://github.com/shareme">Github.com</a>.</p>

<p>You can find other sectors where hacking is shown off at such places as:
