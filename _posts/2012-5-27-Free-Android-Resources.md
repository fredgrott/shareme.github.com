With the influx of new developers, itmust seemotnew android Developers that
they are lost. Hopefuly this resoruce list should provide some resources to use
to becom un-lost.

# Developer Sites

Well obviously the first resource is developer webistes and thoe are:

[Dev Area of Android.com]('http://developer.android.com/')

[Google's Android Design Site]('http://developer.android.com/design/index.html')

[Android Patterns]('http://www.androidpatterns.com/')

[Android UI Patterns]('http://www.androiduipatterns.com/')

[MAndroidPattrns]('http://androidpttrns.com/')

[Stackoverflow's Android Developer Forums](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/android)


# Tools

Google has focused their development effforts not only on the SDK itself and the 
emulator but also the IDE plugin as well:


[Android SDK and NDK]('http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html')

[Google's Eclipse ADT plugin]('http://developer.android.com/sdk/eclipse-adt.html')

[Eclipse IDE]('http://eclipse.org/downloads')

[Motorola Mobility Dev IDE based on Eclipse ]('http://developer.motorola.com/tools/motodevstudio/download/')


# Code repos and Examples

So you may have went through the code samples in the Android SDK and noticed that 
not all areas are up-to-date. Obviously, the popular developer book authors keep
their code examples up-to-date so lets list them:

[Mark Murphy CommonsGuy CommonsWare git repos]('https://github.com/commonsguy')

[Marakana's git repos]('https://github.com/marakana')

[Vanevery's Apress Android Media Pro git repo]('https://github.com/vanevery/Pro-Android-Media')

[Sidelabs' Apress Pro Android Web Apps git repo]('https://github.com/sidelab/prowebapps-code')

[RaghvaSood's Apress Pro Android Augmented Reality  git repo]('https://github.com/RaghavSood/ProAndroidAugmentedReality')

[Android inPractice repo at GoogleCode](http://code.google.com/p/android-in-practice/)

[Unlocking Android Manning code repo at GoogleCode](http://code.google.com/p/unlocking-android/)

[Android in Action Manning's code repo at GoogleCode](http://code.google.com/p/android-in-action/)

# Added Value Code repos

Google has stated that they are working on codig kits to ease development and these
are expected to be added to the additional libraries in the android SDK. Until those
are released you might find these helpful in bootstrapping your android application
development:
