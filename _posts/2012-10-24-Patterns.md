What I am finding in developing the GWSHolointegration UI library is that we as 
java developers may have not found everything of moile UI patterns. Let me explain.


In prior to Android 4.0, ICS, we have aperformance hit on non-compile time java 
annotations. In DI paralance that would be type 2. Performance for ICS was fixed 
just not before it as far as OEMs and mobile operators updating the android OS on 
devices for such a fix.

Thus, that forces us to choose components that use DI to only sue compile time 
annotations instead of run-time annotations. For example, in UIs an event bus that 
does not use annotations in my case(ie Event Bus from greenrobot insted of Square's Otto).

The publish and subscribe model of from both is borrowed from Swing UI. Using 
such a model in UIs reduces by ahuge factor the interfaces, callbacks, etc used.
Sort of an anti-pattern if you will.

Anti-pattern becuase we still get the value of decoupling that normal MVC, MVVM, etc 
patterns deliver but with need to have such a layed pattern structure 
diminished.  Adn mocking for testing and other tasks is so much easier.
