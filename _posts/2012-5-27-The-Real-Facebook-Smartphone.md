Yes, there is a real Faacebook smartphone being worked on at the moment, But, first
before I go over the clues all this is opinion as they may have feed false 
information to those that they attempt to recruit.

# Where is Facebook's Growth

See that IPO hickup lately?  It was not the the decrease in ads directly that
influenced the downgrade among analysts. Look at what was not stated, we have a 
change in DAU and ad revenue but the new users numbers was not discused. And its not
anincrease inmobile users its what part of that mobile user increase in FB users is
new users that reflects on where the focus of the DAU and ad revenue decrease due to 
mobile users should be focused upon. Why?

Because an increase in new FB users who happen tobe mobile users can slow an ad
revenue decrease to change in DAu mong desktop and mobile users. That slowing of
adrevenue decreases woudl than of course postively impact FN stock valuation and
stock price.

Facebook is saturated as far as users growth in the US and Europe as you can only
be on internet so many hours per day and FB market share of US internet users is
already above 80% in the US and Europe.The next biggest markets for FB user growth 
are Indian and China. India is on a road to move towards China styled internet 
censorship and China already has that in which access to non country compliant 
services like Goolge are an hinderance.

# The OEM Connection

And both countries present a challenge of making a low cost smartphone that
gets inot the massees hands.  Currnetly, HTC already pursues a non-google expereince 
smartphone approach with Baidu using a customized Android OS for that purpose.

It would not surpirse me if FB buys HTC considering right now that HTC is worth 
about at the lowend $10 billion. Or it might purpoe just a partnership given that
Android 4.0 already sports a social sharing intent that includes facebook.

If FB was pursuing an active customize their own Android OS with their own hand picked chipset
you would have saw an increase in android OS cusotmization job ads with fb listed as emplyer, 
this has not happened. Thus, I believe that FB is designing the phone but HTC is 
the OEM partner that will build the device at least for the China market and FB
has strived to make sure that FB isnot fully banned in  China.

# The non-Google Experience Android Handset

If FB does partner with HTC than it will not need to hire android application 
developers to replace the Google Exeperience applications as HTC has already 
completed this using Baidu services for the China market. And this is born
out by the android jobpostings that FB is not posting. 

# THe FB experience Smartphone

It is my best opinion and guess that FB will test run a set of FB experience
smartphones for the China market using HTC as the OEM partner. This 
partnership will expand to other markets as the China market  experience 
succeeds.
