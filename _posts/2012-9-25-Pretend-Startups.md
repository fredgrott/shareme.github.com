Names kept out because I believe that these youngsters may be 
surprised by thelesson they find in the next few months. A pretend startup 
is something inwhich a business gets within its head that it needs 
a mobile developer usually because a mobile application has to 
be rewritten or recoded.

In my example Startup A had a mobile android application 80% finsihed from 
a MVP android air application with the air application being a MVP and the 
iphone version being a fully featured mobile application with some added
features. The android native application has severe bugs as they did not 
track at the 20% of antive client finished whether it was up to standards or
not asfaras mobile java apps such as other tasks/threading not on UI thread, etc.

So Startup A gets this bright idea to run a craigslist ad. But not just any craigslist ad, 
you know they type of ad where a certain salary is promised as an indirect 
promise and stock options.  You search for a SEC 10K filing to find proof of 
funding and there is no SEc 10K filing and come to find out that its not even setup 
for even fullfilling the stock options promise as its an LLC which no  
Angel or VC will fund in current form thus the stock potion promise is not
worth the paper its printed on.

What the startup should have done is allow the questioning developer morph it
back into what it should have been a project contract to rewrite the 
android native application at freelance rates. It would be expensive 
but the android native applciation than would not be buggy as hell and have a 
hope of being capabale of being published rather than rely on the 
impoosible hope that someone could clean it up while coding the rest 
of the 20%.

But instead for whatever set of reasons the StartUp A decided to play
some game on the mobile developer. If you are a business needing an
android native application do not play this game as its real easy 
to find even hidden information to determine that this game is being
played. And if a developer preaches to you they need 3 items; 
honesty, transparency, and funding its very much a given that they 
have found out the hidden information and giving you a very big 
hint to come clean.
