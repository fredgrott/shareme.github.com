There is very interesting connection between agile development and android mobile 
application marketing. You did not think they were related did you? Well, they are in 
fact directly related.

# Ten To One

Free android applications are downlaoded 10 times to 1 compared to free android 
applications. No matter what market segment you look at its a ten to one ratio.
And the conversion from a free user to a paid user is TWO percent.

The average ad revenue per ad is TWO cents but the pay for converting a free 
user to apaid user if its your paid app is NINETY-NINE cents assuming a NINETY-NINE cent 
application price.

# ad Impresssions Yours vs Networks

Now for the magic. When you place an ad in ad network where your free app has less 
downloads than the app receiving the ad what do you think happens to the number of 
impressions? Its less when compared to the full 100% impressions you have of 
executing your own banner ad pairing your free app to your paid app.



# The call for Agile Development

That translates to higher revenue, ie payment, if you adopt an agile development and 
do application pairing where you develop a free application and you use the banner ad
to point to your own paid application.

Yes, agile development and developing a set of agile integration tools may be very boring.
Until you realize that the revenue checks are kind of interesting. NINETY-NINE cents 
compared to TWO cents per paid mobile application user is always interesting.
