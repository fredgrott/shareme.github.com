Okay, reports are ciciling that Android 4.1, Jellybean is coming somewhat like now.
The online store was showing the next version of Nexus as coming with 4.1 not 
just in the text description but it had the new 4.1 google search bar, its real folks.
Pictures of check out, via DroidLife:

IO App pictures also via Droid Life:

See how the Google Searbar is now glassy in JellyBean? Also notice that we now have a Chrome icon for the broswer.
The new mic icon probably indicates the new voice search AI being released(majel).

# Meaning

Google did later the text description afer someone in media posted it. However, the
device screenshot showng the new google search  bar in 4.1 has not been altered in 
the pictures showing the IO app.

Thus, we probably will see a demo of full 4.1 Jellybean this next week and that would put 4.1 
coming out this fall.

# 4.1?

The meaning of Jellybean being 4.1 instead of 5.0 begs what is in store for 2013 and 
5.0.Keylime.  It should be interesting to what tunrs up in 4.1 and 5.0.
