The finer details when Google releases activation numbers, <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57510994-94/google-500-million-android-devices-activated/">the verge</a>, always gets misseed by main media. 
So lets fix that. This spring we had 1 million activations daily.

Now, we have 1.3 million activations daily with Android 4.x at 20% of market share penatration.
So what does mean? Thus, depsite Apple's little strategic legal miss-direction blunder Android will
be at 1 billion with a b devices world wide in 6 months with iphone only being 500 million.

How many are ready for the Android tipping point now upon us? And we have other things 
with both Google Play and Amazon Appstore finally wakin gup to add more 
international markets and actually competing with each other to make both better for 
indie developers and application publishers.
