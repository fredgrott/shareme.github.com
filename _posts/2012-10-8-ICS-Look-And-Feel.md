Want to know a secret?  come real close...
The ICS UI look and feel has been back ported to 2.1 to almost 
96%.  The reason why we did not notice is that its spread over about 
20 plus library frameworks.

Thus, I am putting togther a compact collection of these libraries as 
one android project library and redoing the demos for each one and 
doing an API back port chart showing what is covered. For those that 
cannot wait you have one option.

Use the Google search colon prefix operator than the github dot com 
base url and than android UI port to find some. You already know the 
two basic foundation ones being ActionBarSherlock and Holoeverywhere 
but there are others as well. For example the switch widget, drag area, collapsible search, etc.

Yeah, I will even be adding two or more of my back ports as well to this 
integration library and I thank all those code authors who took the time 
to dig through Android source code and back port a class or many classes.

One side note a lot of this stuff is talked about on the G+ android 
dev circles, you really need to join those today and start folowing them and 
particiapte in a discussion or two.

When the API back port chart shoiwng the individual projects? The 
blog post andpage should be up by this weekend.
