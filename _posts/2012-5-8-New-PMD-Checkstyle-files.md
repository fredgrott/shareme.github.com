Since we now have Android Lint to use I modified PMD and Cehckstyle configuration files to decrease 
false positives, etc. These current files are for android tools 20 or higher. You can find them here:

[CodeDroidCodeQA]('https://bitbucket.org/fredgrott/codedroidcodeqa/overview')

Since I am currently testing androdi tools 20 it is android tools 20 or higher which I imagine Google
wil release soemtime at the ned of May.
