With some Obama new legislation the idiots have come out of the wood-work thus
might be time to state how to get me to do a project for your start-up. Its somewhat
simple here is what I ask for in that first meeting.

# First Meeting

Sice I am providing demo applications often done after fidning out about the 
stnart-up to correspond to the start-up mission I ask for these things for the
first meeting:

<ul>
<li>Budget range and proof of cash on hand to pay for project</li>
<li>Project summary with details about the feature set of the android application</li>
<li>Your startup is traveling to my location and paying for the meeting meal</li>
<li>Terms are often 50% cash upfront and 50% cash on delivery</li>
<li>Proof of CPA and lawyer for the corporation and of course incorporation</li>
</ul>

First, and foremost at least in the USA there is a little known Federal Act that 
governs paying computer programmers that was enacted during the Clinton years
that basically states that a minimum(it snow about $2400 per month) be 
paid to the computer programmerr if they are working over 40 hours a week. Although,
its a civil law the IRs likes to have their payroll taxes and thus you hav to follow it as 
a start-up.

Second, for our interests to be aligned the start-up has to have money in the game
and part of that is basically paying the miminum amount or more incash as stock 
options is 100% risk and has ot be treated as such given now the high influx of 
failed businesses now re-branding themselves as start-ups to get free work.

Third, to get me to bet on you your start-up has to become a non-strnager to me and
that takes time. Somewhat more time than 30 minutes thus you should be prepared 
for a several hour meeting and often several meetings.



# What if Cannot meet terms?

What if you cannto meet terms? Well, the local temp agencies charge $120 per hour and 
require a deposit for new businesses without credit records. With at least me 
you are getting a lower immediate price with a portion delayed(if I choose your start-up)
until the stock shows some value.

Proof of incorporation and having a CPA and lawyer for the corporation is requried as
if you are granting stock and cash for a project than you have to file certain 
validated statements with the State Seurities Commission and the SEC upon that
stock grant. CPA required as the value fo stock issued has to be correct as it cannot
just be some figure pulled out of the air by the founder. Usually, the founder puts
in cash for issuance of stock and that stock value than sets the value of the 
next stock issuance.

# validation

Please understand that I validate information before that first meeting with your start-up.
That means I will look up the SEC reports your  start-up filed to see how much stock was 
issued as it states inthose SEC records whether it was cash or not and what the 
funds went to,ie whether or not funds went to the founder. And I look up other 
things to validate information. Your best path is to be honest and transparent as 
you of course as a start-up founder want a best fit for producing that prototype or
product and being honest and transparent to determine fit is the best path

# Be Nice

Last, be nice. It goes without saying that if I choose not to do your android project 
not to come into my email box and start insulting me. That is not professionalism and that
is not class and that type of BS reputation gets around in the Angel VC community as
most of us skilled devloeprs do in fact have weekly conversations with 
Angel VCs. 

# what if you want a Tech Co-founder

One mobile project is not enough to base you askig for a Tech co-founder as it has to 
be a lot more than that as we have idiots out there that use that excuse to ask for
free work. If the idea has that millions of of dollar value to you that you will
make every effort to get the resources for the start-up and often that requires
doing the same thing as normal business in that you save and find seed capital 
to build that first prototype.

And to be perfectly frank, no developer will become a tech co-founder for 
strangers.
