One of the distinct problems of developing applications for the android platform 
is maintinaing the look and feel across multiple android OS versions. Thus, new side 
project to fix that sort of by interating pieces of the puzzle that some have solved.

My starting place is Chris V's HoloEverywhere project at:

<a href="https://github.com/ChristopheVersieux/HoloEverywhere">HoloEverywhere(github)</a>

He took the 4.x classes that the new Holo look is dependent upon and back ported 
them all the way back to android 1.6.


If I add the right additional fonts, themes, and some accesory classes I can 
have a powerfull library that helps me maintain a consistent look and feel
across all the OEM skins across multiple android OS versions.

So might be some screenshots coming.
