Hard to believe we are approaching Android 5.0. At Google IO next week we and the 
whole world will be presented with a sneak peak of features in Android 5.0.

# 5 Features

These are guesses and are not to be taken as factual.  First, Motorola now MM has for 
awhile had this product(nicknamed Android Home) that runs as an application and when you plugin your device into 
a dock with a big display plugin you are presented with new UI interface that allows 
you to use your device as a slim PC.

Recently Ubuntu showed their own version that went a little further and brought in some 
Ubuntu features to the combination. This is important for several reasons.

At this time we are barely into multi-cpu devices and large ram sizs 500megs or more. 
When that reaches to above 1 gig ram and the processor speed gets to a stable 2GHZ
what we have is actually something that was envisioned and hinted at with Apple Newton, 
namely the common computer for everyone that has this set of knowledge AIs that 
serve us.

Now of course in certain countries, yeah you USA, broadband speeds and coverage 
areas has to improve to LTE speeds and national wide coverage. But that should 
happen in the next 18 to 36 months.

The other important feature is a full  finish port of the hardware acceleration throughout 
the full UI.  Whle Android 4.0 did bring it closer from the slim API that was in in 
Android 3.0 it would be nice if it was fully polished, unfortunately I do not think they can 
fully backport the full api to Android 3.0.

# Feature Hopes

The one feeature I hope for is more of an infrastructure hope. See when Google acquired 
Motorola or MM it had a service thatit allowed mobile poerators to use that is useful 
for the android ecosystem.  It was the infrastructure required to actually CDNized, is that even 
a word, the delivery of a mobile OS update to the mobile operators cusomters devices.

Now imagine if Google took that same infrastructure and basically offered it to anyone in the
OHA in such a way to it allowed OEMs to concentrate on other things and allowed 
mobile operators more flexibility in being able to meet cusomter demands for an 
updated androdi OS on their device.

# Nice to  haves

I would like the devices in markeplace dashboard improved to show things like how
much of percentage of android devices have multi-cpus, that would be handy asi it would
help all developers make use of their performance coding choices. Up until 
now each developer had to scour internet for infrequent free market reports that make
some attempt to best guess at that percentage. For example, my own best guess is that 
we will be at 80% market share for android devices with multi-cpus in 18 months or 
less.

# Webkit, New Chrome Fork

Also Jellybean is the first full  release to feature a webkit fork namely fully chromized.
While some of the features added are obvious such as tabs, I am wondering what improvements 
get passd down to webkitview for developers to use. Will we have the performance gains
that than allow us to use weblit view say in a AppWidget? Wiil dart make an appearance?

# Google IO

Some changes you might notice with this Goolge IO is that local GTUG chapters are 
partening with other groups to allow develoeprs to go to those locations to 
view the  IO events being live rebroadcast if you were not lucky enough to get a ticket to
the IO event itself. If you have not joined one of these groups, I just got my invite to
attend the IO reboradcast in the Chicago area due to my membership in Chicago GUTG
 and ChicagoAndroid, this would be the time to join one  and attend their Google IO 
 rebroadcast live event. The easy way to do that is go to Meetup dot com and 
 type in GTUG android and your city, state and zipcode and it will find one close to 
 your city.
 
 Looking forward to this Goolge IO.
