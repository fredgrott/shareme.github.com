So which Android OS will be on the Goole supplied tablets at Google IO 2012? If it 
is android OS 4.1, JellyBean, than we have some interesintg things coming up this fall 2012.

# Minor Version Increments

Google has always released a Major Android OS version in the same year as a minor 
Android OS release that got annnounced at Google IO.

The last release we had like this was Froyo in the spring of 2010 and Gingnerbread got 
released in December 2010. This would put Android 5.0, KeyLime Pie out sometime this fall. 
Its the same amount of months between 4.0 and 4.1 as was with Froyo and Gingerbread.

# What is in KeyLime Pie?

Google has to answer Amazons tablet challenge as its 80% of the android tablet market.
Amazons modifications of Android 2.3.4 focused on a cloud centric browser and integrated 
consumer cloud services. KeyLimePie is the integration of what is being announced as 
far as cloud Services at Google IO 2012 for the consumer.

We will see a more cloud based browser for Google tablets with KeyLimePie with it
routing web page requests through Google cloud infrastructure just as Amazon did 
with their KindleFire browser. We will also see better offline integration with 
Google Cloud services. Remember, Google used to use Gears for that set of featues, 
it might be use of Nodejs instead.

That is KeyLimePie, Android 5.0, in October or December of 2012.
